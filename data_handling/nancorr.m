	%NANCORR Linear or rank correlation.
%   RHO = NANCORR(X) returns a P-by-P matrix containing the pairwise linear
%   correlation coefficient between each pair of columns in the N-by-P
%   matrix X.
%
%   RHO = NANCORR(X,Y,...) returns a P1-by-P2 matrix containing the pairwise
%   correlation coefficient between each pair of columns in the N-by-P1 and
%   N-by-P2 matrices X and Y.
%
%   [RHO,PVAL] = NANCORR(...) also returns PVAL, a matrix of p-values for
%   testing the hypothesis of no correlation against the alternative that
%   there is a non-zero correlation.  Each element of PVAL is the p-value
%   for the corresponding element of RHO.  If PVAL(i,j) is small, say less
%   than 0.05, then the correlation RHO(i,j) is significantly different
%   from zero.
%
%   [...] = NANCORR(...,'PARAM1',VAL1,'PARAM2',VAL2,...) specifies additional
%   parameters and their values.  Valid parameters are the following:
%
%        Parameter  Value
%         'type'    'Pearson' (the default) to compute Pearson's linear
%                   correlation coefficient, 'Kendall' to compute Kendall's
%                   tau, or 'Spearman' to compute Spearman's rho.
%         'rows'    'all' (default) to use all rows regardless of missing
%                   values (NaNs), 'complete' to use only rows with no
%                   missing values, or 'pairwise' to compute RHO(i,j) using
%                   rows with no missing values in column i or j.
%         'tail'    The alternative hypothesis against which to compute
%                   p-values for testing the hypothesis of no correlation.
%                   Choices are:
%                      TAIL         Alternative Hypothesis
%                   ---------------------------------------------------
%                     'both'     correlation is not zero (the default)
%                     'right'    correlation is greater than zero
%                     'left'     correlation is less than zero
%
%   The 'pairwise' option for the 'rows' parameter can produce RHO that is
%   not positive semi-definite.  The 'complete' option always produces a
%   positive semi-definite RHO, but when data are missing, the estimates
%   may be based on fewer observations.
%
%   NANCORR computes p-values for Pearson's correlation using a Student's t
%   distribution for a transformation of the correlation.  This is exact
%   when X and Y are normal.  NANCORR computes p-values for Kendall's tau and
%   Spearman's rho using either the exact permutation distributions (for
%   small sample sizes), or large-sample approximations.
%
%   NANCORR computes p-values for the two-tailed test by doubling the more
%   significant of the two one-tailed p-values.
