function [varargout]=gscatter3(x,y,z,g,clr,mrksle,mrksze,mrkfclr,leg,legloc)
%------------------------------HELP START----------------------------------
% gscatter3 - 3D scatter plot by group
%
% Ussage:
%       gscatter3(x,y,z,g);
%       gscatter3(x,y,z,g,opt_param);
%           opt_param - optional parameters such as color, marker style,
%           marker size, marker face color, legend & legend location
%       h=gscatter3(...);
%
% Input arguments:
%       x, y & z - vector arrays of data points of same size
%
%       g - grouping variable either a cell array of strings or a vector of
%       length equal to the length of x, y and z or a character array with
%       no. of rows equal to the length of x, y and z.
%
%       clr - coloring variable either a cell array of strings or a
%       character array or a 3-element vector of length equal to length of
%       g or no. of groups or a character string representing a pre-defined
%       colormap
% Possible colormap names:
% {'jet','hsv','hot','cool','spring','summer','autumn','winter','gray
%     ','bone','copper','pink','lines'};
% Possible color strings:
% {'b','g','r','c','m','y','k'};
%
%       mrksle - marker style either a cell array of strings or a character
%       array of length equal to length of g or no. of groups
% Possible marker styles:
% {'+','o','*','.','x','s','d','^','v','<','>','p','h'}
%
%       mrksze - marker size, a scalar representing size in points
%
%       mrkfclr - marker face color either 'auto' representing colors as
%       represented by clr or 'none'; this is applicable only to following
%       marker styles (circle, square, diamond, pentagram, hexagram, and the
%       four triangles)
%
%       leg - logical one or zero representing whether a legend is
%       displayed or not
%
%       legloc - location of legend
% Possible legend locations:
% North: Inside plot box near top
% South: Inside bottom
% East: Inside right
% West: Inside left
% NorthEast: Inside top right
% NorthWest: Inside top left
% SouthEast: Inside bottom right
% SouthWest: Inside bottom left
% NorthOutside: Outside plot box near top
% SouthOutside: Outside bottom
% EastOutside: Outside right
% WestOutside: Outside left
% NorthEastOutside: Outside top right (default)
% NorthWestOutside: Outside top left
% SouthEastOutside: Outside bottom right
% SouthWestOutside: Outside bottom left
% Best: Least conflict with data in plot
% BestOutside: Least unused space outside plot
%
% Output arguments:
%       h - handles to all line objects in the figure
%
% Note: Minimum first three input arguments are required. This function is
% compatible with both MATLAB & OCTAVE
