Multi-functional data analysis programs

This repository contains a range of different MATLAB functions that are all provided as-is. There are no guarantees that anything will work, but most of the supplied functions should work fine. Some functions are well documented, others not at all. If you're interesting in contributing to this eclectic mix of handy and less handy functions, send me a message.
